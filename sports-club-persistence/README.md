###Zadanie:
Think of a sports club for a team sport (football, ice hockey etc.). 
Create a system managing teams and players. Each team is defined by its 
name and an age group (men, juniors etc.) given by an interval between 
two years of birth. Each player is described by his first name, last name, 
height, weight and date of birth. Each team has a roster of players listing 
their jersey numbers on the team. It is important that each player's age 
group matches the age group of the team, but a player is allowed to be on 
the roster of a team one level above (i.e. a younger player can be on the 
team of a higher age group). That implies a player can be listed on multiple 
team rosters.
